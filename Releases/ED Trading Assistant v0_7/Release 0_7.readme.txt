Changes for 0.7

-Optimized the route calculations for the Adviser.
	1. Routes that have short circuited (visited the same station twice) are no longer considered by the Adviser.
	2. Route comparisons for each centered system/station stop as soon as adding the next highest manifest results in a decrease of the average profit per trip.
	3. Route results are pared down by only providing the best average profit per jump for each centered system/station.

-Fixed tabbing on dialog windows.

-Added Accept and Cancel buttons where appropriate.
